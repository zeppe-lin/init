.Dt INIT 8
.Os init #VERSION#
.Sh NAME
.Nm init
.Nd simple init
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the parent of all processes. It is configured by modifying
.Dq config.h
and recompiling the code.
.Ss Init sequence
By default
.Nm
will execute
.Dq /etc/rc.boot .
You can chain your init scripts together at that point to allow for
single-user and multi-user operation.
.Ss Signal handling
.Nm
will respond to the following signals:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxx
.It USR1
Default action is to initiate the shutdown sequence by
executing
.Dq /etc/rc.shutdown poweroff .
.It INT
Default action is to initiate the reboot sequence by
executing
.Dq /etc/rc.shutdown reboot .
.It CHLD
Reap children.
.El
.Ss General considerations
Running the
.Dq rc.shutdown
script directly is not recommended.  If any
process in your session has stale filesystem references then it is
likely your init scripts will fail to unmount the filesystem cleanly.
It is recommended to signal
.Nm
via a wrapper scripts: 
.Xr poweroff 8 ,
.Xr reboot 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
does not clear utmp records.  The version of
.Xr getty 8
in ubase clears the utmp entries on the specified tty before it
spawns the given program, usually
.Xr login 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
does not restart
.Xr getty 8
or interact with it in any way.  You will need an external
respawning mechanism to restart it, for example
.Xr respawn 1 .
